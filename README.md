This was built with the intention of entertaining the player, with a classic game from almost everyone’s childhood. Main objectives are: 

- to cheer up the player's mood
- to challenge the computer’s logic 
- to sharpen the player’s prediction skill 
- and most importantly to have fun

## Why This

Many of us are familiar with this game, we can even call it a classic. If you were born in the 80s like me, then you would remember that there weren't any electronics around like today, we'd play outside all day with our friends, and the rock, paper, scissors game is one of the most popular ones amongst many others. And very often, this little game also functions as a perfect solution for who starts first for a different game that we were planning to play. Here is why I chose to do this. Because of the global pandemic, we were advised not to gather with people, keep social distance, not to travel etc, basically to reduce the spread, each family needed to form and live their own babbles. For us human beings, this of course will make us feel lonely sometimes. My objective is by building this good old classy game, the player can play it wherever and whenever they would like. Hoping to bring back some of the great memories of your childhood and finally to cheer you up a little in this uncertain time.
